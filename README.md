# Walmart Retail Sales Prediction

## project overview
```bash
Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets (also called supercenters), discount department stores, and grocery stores in the United States, headquartered in Bentonville.
```
## Business objectives
```bash
This project aims to develop machine learning model for the Walmart Retail shop to address the challenges of predicting selling price and lead classification. Manual predictions can be time-consuming and may not result in optimal pricing decisions or accurately capture leads. The models will utilize advanced techniques such as data normalization, outlier detection and handling, handling data in the wrong format, identifying the distribution of features, and leveraging tree-based models, specifically the decision tree algorithm, to predict the selling price and leads accurately
 ```
## Key Technologies and Skills
```bash
* Python
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Streamlit
* Joblib
```
## Project scope
The solution includes the following steps:

## 1. Data Collection:
* Gather historical sales data from various Walmart stores, including information on products, sales volume, dates, and store locations.
* Collect external data on factors that may influence sales, such as weather, economic indicators, and social media trends.
## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Conduct comprehensive EDA to understand data distributions, identify patterns and trends, and detect potential outliers or inconsistencies.
* Gain insights into the relationships between different factors and sales to inform feature engineering and model selection.

## 3. Feature Engineering:

* Transform and engineer informative features from the raw data to enhance model performance.
* Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables appropriately to ensure data integrity.

## 4. Model Development:

* Experiment with various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks, to identify the most suitable model for sales prediction.

## 5. Model Deployment:

* Deploy the trained model in a production environment, such as a cloud platform or on-premises servers, to enable real-time sales predictions.
* Develop a user-friendly interface or API to allow users to interact with the model and obtain sales forecasts.

## 6. Model Monitoring and Improvement:

* Continuously monitor the model's performance and track key metrics to detect any degradation in accuracy over time.
* Implement mechanisms for retraining and updating the model with new data and insights to maintain its effectiveness.

  




## Getting Started
To begin working with the Walmart Retail Sales Prediction project, follow these simple steps:

## 1.Clone the Repository:
* Start by copying this project from GitHub to your computer. Just type the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AjithAnalytics/Data_Science_Final_Project.git
```
## 2.Download Model Pickle

* Note: After downloading the pickle file, ensure to store it in the same folder as your project files for proper functionality.

## 3.Install the Required Packages:
* Make sure you have all the necessary tools installed. Do this by typing the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 4.Run the Streamlit App:
* Fire up the Streamlit application using this command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
##5.Access the App in Your Browser:
* Open your internet browser and go to http://localhost:8501. You should see the app there.
* Now you're all set! You've got the project on your machine, installed what you need, and can access the app in your browser. Happy exploring!
